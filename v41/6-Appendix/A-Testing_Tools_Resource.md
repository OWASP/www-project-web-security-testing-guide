## Acceptance Testing Tools

Acceptance testing tools are used to validate the functionality of web applications. Some follow a scripted approach and typically make use of a Unit Testing framework to construct test suites and test cases. Most, if not all, can be adapted to perform security specific tests in addition to functional tests.

- [BDD Security](https://github.com/continuumsecurity/bdd-security)

### Open Source Tools

  - A Java and JUnit based framework that uses the Apache HttpClient as the transport.
  - Very robust and configurable and is used as the engine for a number of other testing tools.
- [jWebUnit](https://jwebunit.github.io/jwebunit/)
  - A Java based meta-framework that uses htmlunit or selenium as the testing engine.
- [HttpUnit](http://httpunit.sourceforge.net)
